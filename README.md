This is my first Rails app. I'm attempting to write a listserv program for a small group of users.

The code for secret\_token.rb comes from [Michael Hartl's  Rails Tutorial](http://www.railstutorial.org).

Most of the code, so far comes from this tutorial, which if you haven't read it is a wonderful start to the world of Rails coding. I made some minor tweaks to the user model he presented, but for the most part, the code here is the same as the sample app.

The next step is to implement the listserv function, and this is where I'm stabbing out on my own into uncharted territory. We'll see how that goes.
